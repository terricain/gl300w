# GL300W Asset Tracker UDP Server

This is a small go project implementing a UDP server to receive events from a GL300 GPS tracker publishing said messages to Kafka.

Why? Mainly I wanted to have a play with Go's code generation as well as Kafka in general.

## Resources:

The protocol seems to be called Track Air, or at least if you google GL300 protocol you'll find a PDF to that description.
